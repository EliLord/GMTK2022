This is a short gamejam project I worked on with two coworkers. The game jam theme was "roll of the dice", and our concept was a top down game against enemy dice, where the player gets to choose an inventory of weapons at the start, and gets a new randomized weapon from what they've chosen every time they do a dodge roll. My work can primarily be seen in the Scripts/Weapons, Attack, Character, and Enemy folders. I did the work on most of the gameplay features such as attacking and enemy AI, while one of my coworkers created the menu system, UI, and character controller, and a third did the art.

Unfortunately we did not get as far as we had hoped due to one of my coworkers falling ill partway through, but I kept working a bit to make it playable and I am still happy with what we produced.
